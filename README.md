## Usage Instructions

This branch shows how we can implement the LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle) to our code.

1. Creating new classes for each Policy Type (Flood, Land, Life and Auto)
2. Creating a RaterFactory class will give us to manage the switch statement out side the Engine class.
3. Adding a exception for unknown policy types. (UnknownPolicyRater class)
