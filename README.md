## Usage Instructions

This branch shows how we can implement the SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) to our code.

1) Adding a new class named ConsoleLogger and replacing all Console.WriteLine with the new method in this class (Log)
2) Adding a new class named FileSource and getting data over this class

With this small changes we are delegating the details to other classes. These classes will doing only one thing and it is more easy to managing

## Key Takeaways

-> Each class should have a single responsibility, or reason to change
-> Strive for high cohesion and loose coupling
