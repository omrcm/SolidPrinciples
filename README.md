# SOLID Principles for C# Developers | Liskov Substitution Principle

A sample application used to demonstrate SOLID principles. This code base is cloned from main repository and
modified to show how LSP works

## Usage Instructions

This branch shows how we can implement the LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle) to our code.

Follow the "Tell, Don't Ask" principle <br/>
Minimize null checks with<br/>
    - C# features <br/>
    - Guard clauses <br/>
    - Null Object design pattern<br/>

Follow ISP and be sure to fully implement interfaces. In this repo we have created a new class named RatingContext and this class
is using IRatingContext

## Key Takeaways

-> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types<br/>
-> Ensure base type invariants are enforced
-> Look for;
    - Type checking
    - Null checking
    - NotImplementedException
