# SOLID Principles for C# Developers | Interface Segregation Principle

A sample application used to demonstrate SOLID principles. This code base is cloned from main repository and
modified to show how ISP works <br/>

-> Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use <br/>

What is Client? <br/>

The client is the code that is interacting with an instance of the interface. It's the calling code <br/>

Minimize interfaces as mush as you can <br/>

More Dependencies Means </br>

* More coupling
* More brittle code
* More difficult testing
* MOre difficult deployments
