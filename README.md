# SOLID Principles for C# Developers | Dependency Inversion Principle

A sample application used to demonstrate SOLID principles. This code base is cloned from main repository and
modified to show how DIP works

## Give a Star! :star:

## Usage Instructions

This branch shows how we can implement the DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle) to our code.

The following changes were applied;

* New folder structure applied
* Because of the "New is Glue" phrase new interfaces are created and applied to needed classes
* Multiple loggers created

## Key Takeaways

* Most classes should depend on abstractions, not implementation details
* Abstractions shouldn't leak details
* Classes should be explicit about their dependencies
* Clients should inject dependencies when they create other classes
* Structure your solution to leverage dependency inversion
